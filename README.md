# Warm-Up Exercises

Individual exercises to start the day right.

We will release an exercise at 8:50 am daily. You have until 9:15 am to complete the assignment.

There will be 10 minutes at the end to wrap up. The format for this will vary.

## Setup

Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises.git
```

When the assignment is released, `git pull` to get the assignment.

A solution will sometimes be released at 9:15. In order to be able to pull those changes from the master, you will need to either commit or stash your changes:

```sh
git commit -m "Complete assignment X"
git pull
```

or:

```sh
git stash save "Assignment X"
git pull
git stash pop
```
